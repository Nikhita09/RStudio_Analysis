MPG Regression

Looking at the Pr(>|t|) values we can see that both vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically significant as the values are less than 0.05.
We can conclude that there is a positive relationship between MPG - vehicle length and MPG - ground clearance.
The R-squared value is ~70% which means 70% of all predictions using the model will be accurate. Therefore we can say that the model predicts MPG of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
The Ho = Slope of the equation is 0. Since the p-value is 2.277e-11 which is far lesser than the significance level 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the slope of the equation is not zero.



Suspension Coil Summary

Mean PSI = 1498.78
Median PSI = 1500
Variance PSI = 62.3
Std Dev PSI = 7.9

Looking at the overall summary we can say that the variance meets the MechaCar requirement (less than 100).
However, looking at each lot we can see that while Lot1 and Lot2 meet the requirement, Lot3 variance is 170 which is way above the threshold.



Suspension Coil T-Test

Doing a one sample T-Test to see if mean PSI = 1500. The test results show that the p-value is 0.06.
Since it is greater than the significance level 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis thereby concluding that the mean PSI is equal to 1500.
